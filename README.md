# Greetings, dear reader! My name is Maxim... 
I am glad to see you on my **personal profile**, where you can see the history of my development in the *field of system software Developer*, and where you can find something interesting for yourself.


## A little bit about yourself
I am a single-minded person, always striving to achieve the desired or at least working result... I'm not going to lie. ðŸ˜… 
I am familiar with programming languages such as Python 3.11, C#, but mostly study C/C++, in love with the elegance and power of Linux systems. I believe that the best code is simple and intuitive code that solves complex problems and does it flawlessly. ðŸ¦¾
