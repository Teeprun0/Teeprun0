# Greetings, dear reader, my name is Maxim! ðŸ˜Š
I am glad to see you in my sweet corner of creation, where you can see the beginning of my journey from learning how to code to a level capable of creating miracles with the help of code. If you are interested in learning how I overcame all these difficulties and how I became a professional developer, then I am happy to invite you to look at any repository that interests you and even learn something new for yourself. I hope you like it here! 



## ðŸŒ± A little bit about yourself
I'm a simple guy who got interested in programming back in 2022 and created my own page on the **GitHub** platform in 2025... although I registered in 2024. ðŸ˜… I'm no different from many of the other newcomers here, or even look awkward compared to them... But I'm doing my best, and I really like what I'm doing. Starting in 2022, I actively studied programming with Python and spent about a year mastering the basic skills of writing good code to automatism, after which, in 2023-2024, I created many different projects from small to large and thus *looked for myself in the IT field*... Unfortunately, all these experimental projects have not been preserved to this day, because then I would have been focused on gaining knowledge, and not on developing my capabilities. And it was in 2025 that I found my sincere interest in the field of **"system software"** and I also continue to delve into the knowledge of the system world! ðŸ¥¹
